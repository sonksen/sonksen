In this paper we provide a set of conditions by which we can relatively easily prove the asymptotic posterior normality under quite general situations of possible nonstationarity. This result reinforces and generalizes the point of Sims and Uhlig (1991) that inference based on the likelihood principle, explained by Berger and Wolpert (1988), will be unchanged regardless of whether the data are generated by a stationary process or by a unit root process. On the other hand, our conditions allow us to generalize the Bayesian information criterion known as the Schwarz criterion to the case of possible nonstationarity. In addition, we have shown that consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator, not the asymptotic normality of the estimator, with some minor additional assumptions is sufficient for asymptotic posterior normality.},

     abstract = {Models are considered in which the underlying rate at which events occur can be represented by a regression function that describes the relation between the predictor variables and the unknown parameters. Estimates of the parameters can be obtained by means of iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS). When the events of interest follow the Poisson distribution, the IRLS algorithm is equivalent to using the method of scoring to obtain maximum likelihood (ML) estimates. The general Poisson regression models include log-linear, quasilinear and intrinsically nonlinear models. The approach considered enables one to concentrate on describing the relation between the dependent variable and the predictor variables through the regression model. Standard statistical packages that support IRLS can then be used to obtain ML estimates, their asymptotic covariance matrix, and diagnostic measures that can be used to aid the analyst in detecting outlying responses and extreme points in the model space. Applications of these methods to epidemiologic follow-up studies with the data organized into a life-table type of format are discussed. The method is illustrated by using a nonlinear model, derived from the multistage theory of carcinogenesis, to analyze lung cancer death rates among British physicians who were regular cigarette smokers.},

  abstract={ Australian and New Zealand environmental economists have played a significant role in the development of concepts and their application across three fields within their subdiscipline: non-market valuation, institutional economics and bioeconomic modelling. These contributions have been spurred on by debates within and outside the discipline. Much of the controversy has centred on the validity of valuations generated through the application of stated preference methods such as contingent valuation. Suggestions to overcome some shortcomings in the work of environmental economists include the commissioning of a sequence of non-market valuation studies to fill existing gaps to improve the potential for benefit transfer.

     abstract = {For any probability model $M\equiv \{p(x|\theta,\omega),\theta \in \Theta,\omega \in \Omega \}$ assumed to describe the probabilistic behaviour of data x∈ X, it is argued that testing whether or not the available data are compatible with the hypothesis $H_{0}\equiv \{\theta =\theta _{0}\}$ is best considered as a formal decision problem on whether to use (a0), or not to use (a1), the simpler probability model (or null model) $M_{0}\equiv \{p(x|\theta _{0},\omega),\omega \in \Omega \}$ , where the loss difference L(a0,θ,ω)-L(a1,θ,ω) is proportional to the amount of information δ (θ 0,θ,ω) which would be lost if the simplified model M0 were used as a proxy for the assumed model M. For any prior distribution π (θ,ω), the appropriate normative solution is obtained by rejecting the null model M0 whenever the corresponding posterior expectation $\mathop{\iint}\delta (\theta _{0},\theta,\omega)\pi (\theta,\omega |x)d\theta \ d\omega $ is sufficiently large. Specification of a subjective prior is always difficult, and often polemical, in scientific communication. Information theory may be used to specify a prior, the reference prior, which only depends on the assumed model M, and mathematically describes a situation where no prior information is available about the quantity of interest. The reference posterior expectation, d(θ 0,x)=∫ δ π (δ |x)dδ , of the amount of information δ (θ 0,θ,ω) which could be lost if the null model were used, provides an attractive non-negative test function, the intrinsic statistic, which is invariant under reparametrization. The intrinsic statistic d(θ 0,x) is measured in units of information, and it is easily calibrated (for any sample size and any dimensionality) in terms of some average log-likelihood ratios. The corresponding Bayes decision rule, the Bayesian reference criterion (BRC), indicates that the null model M0 should only be rejected if the posterior expected loss of information from using the simplified model M0 is too large or, equivalently, if the associated expected average log-likelihood ratio is large enough. The BRC criterion provides a general reference Bayesian solution to hypothesis testing which does not assume a probability mass concentrated on M0 and, hence, it is immune to Lindley's paradox. The theory is illustrated within the context of multivariate normal data, where it is shown to avoid Rao's paradox on the inconsistency between univariate and multivariate frequentist hypothesis testing. /// Pour un modèle probabiliste $M\equiv \{p(x|\theta,\omega),\theta \in \Theta,\omega \in \Omega \}$ censé décrire le comportement probabiliste de données x∈ X, nous soutenons que tester si les données sont compatibles avec une hypothèse $H_{0}\equiv \{\theta =\theta _{0}\}$ doit être considéré comme un problème décisionnel concernant l'usage du modèle $M_{0}\equiv \{p(x|\theta _{0},\omega),\omega \in \Omega \}$ , avec une fonction de coût qui mesure la quantité d'information qui peut être perdue si le modèle simplifié M0 est utilisé comme approximation du véritable modèle M. Le coût moyen, calculé par rapport �  une loi a priori de référence idoine fournit une statistique de test pertinente, la statistique intrinsèque d(θ 0,x), invariante par reparamétrisation. La statistique intrinsèque d(θ 0,x) est mesurée en unités d'information, et sa calibrage, qui est independante de la taille de l'échantillon et de la dimension du paramètre, ne dépend pas de sa distribution �  l'échantillonage. La règle de Bayes correspondante, le critère de Bayes de référence (BRC), indique que H0 doit seulement être rejeté si le coût a posteriori moyen de la perte d'information �  utiliser le modèle simplifié M0 est trop grande. Le critère BRC fournit une solution bayésienne générale et objective pour les tests d'hypothèses précises qui ne réclame pas une masse de Dirac concentrée sur M0. Par conséquent, elle échappe au paradoxe de Lindley. Cette théorie est illustrée dans le contexte de variables normales multivariées, et on montre qu'elle évite le paradoxe de Rao sur l'inconsistence existant entre tests univariés et multivariés.},

The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to ∞. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain converges to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straightforward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed.},

A computerized procedure was required that could be routinely used by engineers, unsupervised. The second example is a single, application-specific elicitation of the beliefs of hydrogeologists about properties of certain rocks. A full probability specification was ideally to be obtained from a two-day intensive, supervised, elicitation with several experts together. The two different approaches used for these problems are described and contrasted, but a common principle of trying to identify and elicit separately the various sources of expert uncertainty is identified.},

We identify an asymptotic expansion for this Chi-squared distance and use it to define a functional which can be optimised so as to obtain a reference prior. Performing this optimisation for a unidimensional parameter leads to a prior which is proportional to 1/√detI(θ), where θ is a d-dimensional real parameter and I(θ) is the Fisher information matrix. We argue the relevance of the Chi-squared distance by noting its relationship with the Chi-squared goodness-of-fit statistic and present computational results to show how this Chi-squared reference prior performs for d = 1. In addition, we briefly consider the case where nuisance parameters are present. Finally, we discuss the importance of the choice of measure of distance on prior selection and evaluation.},

no general solution is available for removing nuisance parameters

approaches to construct a general procedure for frequentist
elimination of nuisance parameters through the use of matching
priors. In particular, we perform Bayesian marginalisation with
respect to a prior distribution under which posterior inferences have
approximate frequentist validity. Matching priors are constructed as
solutions to a partial differential equation. Unfortunately, except
in simple cases, these partial differential equations do not yield to
analytical nor even standard numerical methods of solution. We
present a numerical/Monte Carlo algorithm for obtaining the matching
prior, in general, as a solution to the appropriate partial
differential equation and draw posterior inferences. To be specific,
we develop an automated routine through an implementation of the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for deriving frequentist valid
inferences via the matching prior. We illustrate our results in the
contexts of fitting random effects models, fitting logistic
regression models and fitting teratological data by beta-binomial

Ultimately, all components of the formal mathematical models underlying inferential procedures represent quantified judgments. In this study, the focus is on just one component, the prior distribution, and on some of the problems of assessment that arise when a person tries to express prior distributions in quantitative form. The objective is to point toward assessment procedures that can actually be used. One particular type of statistical problem is considered and several techniques of assessment are presented, together with the necessary instruction so that these techniques can be understood and applied. A questionnaire is developed and used in a study in which people actually assess prior distributions. The results indicate that, by and large, it is feasible to question people about subjective prior probability distributions, although this depends on the assessor and on the assessment technique(s) used. A revised questionnaire, which is aimed at potential users of the assessment procedures and future investigators in the area of probability assessment, is presented.},

     abstract = {Subjectivism has become the dominant philosophical
                  foundation for Bayesian inference. Yet in practice,
                  most Bayesian analyses are performed with so-called
                  "noninformative" priors, that is, priors constructed
                  by some formal rule. We review the plethora of
                  techniques for constructing such priors and discuss
                  some of the practical and philosophical issues that
                  arise when they are used. We give special emphasis
                  to Jeffreys's rules and discuss the evolution of his
                  viewpoint about the interpretation of priors, away
                  from unique representation of ignorance toward the
                  notion that they should be chosen by convention. We
                  conclude that the problems raised by the research on
                  priors chosen by formal rules are serious and may
                  not be dismissed lightly: When sample sizes are
                  small (relative to the number of parameters being
                  estimated), it is dangerous to put faith in any
                  "default" solution; but when asymptotics take over,
                  Jeffreys's rules and their variants remain
                  reasonable choices. We also provide an annotated
                  bibliography.},

This has led Bayesians to use conventional proper prior distributions or crude approximations to Bayes factors. In this article we introduce a new criterion called the intrinsic Bayes factor, which is fully automatic in the sense of requiring only standard noninformative priors for its computation and yet seems to correspond to very reasonable actual Bayes factors. The criterion can be used for nested or nonnested models and for multiple model comparison and prediction. From another perspective, the development suggests a general definition of a "reference prior" for model comparison.},

However, there are difficulties with this approach when prior information about the parameters of the various models is weak. Partial Bayes factors offer a resolution of the problem by setting aside part of the data as a training sample. The training sample is used to obtain an initial informative posterior distribution of the parameters in each model. Model comparison is then based on a Bayes factor calculated from the remaining data. Properties of partial Bayes factors are discussed, particularly in the context of weak prior information, and they are found to have advantages over other proposed methods of model comparison. A new variant of the partial Bayes factor, the fractional Bayes factor, is advocated on grounds of consistency, simplicity, robustness and coherence.},

The frequency properties of the new procedure are evaluated in standard examples, and a non-standard example is analysed to show the considerable differences possible between prior and posterior means of the likelihood. Several different justifications of the procedure are given, and a non-Bayesian direct likelihood interpretation is described.},

General results for one-sided testing in location and scale models are then presented. The default Bayes factors are also studied for specific models involving multiple hypotheses. In particular, a multiple hypothesis testing example involving a sequential clinical trial is discussed. In most of the examples presented we also derive the intrinsic prior; this is the prior distribution, which, if used directly, would yield answers (asymptotically) equivalent to those for the given default Bayes factor.},

    abstract = {{Highly Structured Stochastic Systems (HSSS) is a modern strategy for building statistical models for challenging real-world problems, for computing with them, and for interpreting the resulting inferences. Complexity is handled by working up from simple local assumptions in a coherent way, and that is the key to modelling, computation, inference and interpretation; the unifying framework is that of Bayesian hierarchical models. The aim of this book is to make recent developments in HSSS accessible to a general statistical audience.   Graphical modelling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology are central to the field, and in this text they are covered in depth. The chapters on graphical modelling focus on causality and its interplay with time, the role of latent variables, and on some innovative applications. Those on Monte Carlo algorithms include discussion of the impact of recent theoretical work on the evaluation of performance in MCMC, extensions to variable dimension problems, and methods for dynamic problems based on particle filters. Coverage of these underlying methodologies is balanced by substantive areas of application - in the areas of spatial statistics (with epidemiological, ecological and image analysis applications) and biology (including infectious diseases, gene mapping and evolutionary genetics). The book concludes with two topics (model criticism and Bayesian nonparametrics) that seek to challenge the parametric assumptions that otherwise underlie most HSSS models.   Altogether there are 15 topics in the book, and for each there is a substantial article by a leading author in the field, and two invited commentaries that complement, extend or discuss the main article, and should be read in parallel. All authors are distinguished researchers in the field, and were active participants in an international research programme on HSSS.  This is the 27th volume in the Oxford Statistical Science Series, which includes texts and monographs covering many topics of current research interest in pure and applied statistics. These texts focus on topics that have been at the forefront of research interest for several years. Other books in the series include: J.Durbin and S.J.Koopman: Time series analysis by State Space Models; Peter J. Diggle, Patrick Heagerty, Kung-Yee Liang, Scott L.

     abstract = {Lower bounds on Bayes factors in favor of the null hypothesis in multinomial tests of point null hypotheses are developed. These are then applied to derive lower bounds on Bayes factors in both exact and asymptotic chi-squared testing situations. The general conclusion is that the lower bounds tend to be substantially larger than P-values, raising serious questions concerning the routine use of moderately small P-values (e.g., 0.05) to represent significant evidence against the null hypothesis.},

     abstract = {The problem of calculating posterior probabilities for a collection of competing models and associated Bayes factors continues to be a formidable challenge for applied Bayesian statisticians. Current approaches that take advantage of modern Markov chain Monte Carlo computing methods include those that attempt to sample over some form of the joint space created by the model indicators and the parameters for each model, others that sample over the model space alone, and still others that attempt to estimate the marginal likelihood of each model directly (because the collection of these is equivalent to the collection of model probabilities themselves). We review several methods and compare them in the context of three examples: a simple regression example, a more challenging hierarchical longitudinal model, and a binary data latent variable model. We find that the joint model-parameter space search methods perform adequately but can be difficult to program and tune, whereas the marginal likelihood methods often are less troublesome and require less additional coding. Our results suggest that the latter methods may be most appropriate for practitioners working in many standard model choice settings, but the former remain important for comparing models of varying dimension (e.g., multiple changepoint models) or models whose parameters cannot easily be updated in relatively few blocks. We caution, however, that all methods we compared require significant human and computer effort, and this suggests that less formal Bayesian model choice methods may offer a more realistic alternative in many cases.},
